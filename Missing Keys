Some of the keys in a keyboard which supports only lowercase alphabets were not working. Mr. XYZ
presses all the keys in the keyboard one by one in random order. The program must accept a string S
representing the keys typed as the input. Then the program must print the keys which are not working
in alphabetical order as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of String S <= 25
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains alphabets without any space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdefghijlmnopqrtuvwxyz
Output:
ks
Explanation:
The alphabets k and s are missing in the given string abcdefghijlmnopqrtuvwxyz so those keys are not
working.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
zfrsydigxhlounpkewqj
Output:
abcmtv






Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char ch[25];
    scanf("%s",ch);
    int n=strlen(ch);
    for(char i='a';i<='z';i++)
    {
        int cnt=0;
        for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
        {
            if(i==ch[j])
            {
                cnt++;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(cnt==0)
        {
            printf("%c",i);
        }
    }
}
