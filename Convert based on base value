The program must accept three integers N, X and Y as the input. The program must convert N which
is represented with the base as X to the representation with the base as Y. Then the program must
print the revised value with the base as Y.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^7 
2 <= X <= 10
2 <= Y <= 10

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains the integer X.
The third line contains the integer Y.

Output Format:
The first line contains the value with the base as Y.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
25 
6 
8

Output:
21

Explanation:
25 with base 6 is 17 in decimal. 17 represented with base as 8 is 21.
Hence the output is 21

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1001 
2 
10

Output:
9





Code : 

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		long a = sc.nextInt();
		long b = sc.nextInt();
		long c = sc.nextInt();
		long dec=0,base=1;
		while(a > 0)
		{
		    long z = a%10;
		    dec=dec+z*base;
		    base *= b;
		    a/=10;
		}
		long dec1=0,prod=1;
		while(dec > 0)
		{
		    long
		    z = dec%c;
		    dec1 = dec1+z*prod;
		    prod *= 10;
		    dec/=c;
		}
		System.out.print(dec1);
	}
}
