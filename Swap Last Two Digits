The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must swap the last two
digits of X with the last two digits of Y. Then the program must print their product as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
10 <= X, Y <= 10^4
Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the product as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
34 123
Output:
3082
Explanation:
The last two digits in both integers are swapped to get 23 and 134.
The product of the modified integers is 23 * 134 = 3082
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5323 1295
Output:
6598085





Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		int y=sc.nextInt();
		int x1=x%100;
		int y1=y%100;
		x=x/100;
		y=y/100;
		x=x*100;
		y=y*100;
		x+=y1;
		y+=x1;
		System.out.println(x*y);
	}
}
