separated by exactly one space character and the additional space characters (following the first space
character) must be replaced by asterisk (*) if present.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the words as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Practice        makes       perfect
Output:
Practice *******makes ******perfect
Explanation:
The additional spaces between words are replaced by asterisks and printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
The   process     needed     30  minutes    to finish
Output:
The **process ****needed ****30 *minutes ***to finish










Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char ch[1000];
    scanf("%[^\n]",ch);
    int n=strlen(ch);
    int cnt=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(ch[i]==' ' && cnt!=0)
        {
            printf("*");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%c",ch[i]);
            if(ch[i]==' ')
                cnt++;
            else
                cnt=0;
        }
